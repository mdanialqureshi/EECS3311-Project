-- to do list
Planet 9 doesn't attach to star after turns left = 0 (planet alrdy on a star sector initially) 

add reproduced and destroyed outputs 

Test mode fucks up on high thresholds ( it used to give array out of bounds exception but in side the method add_to_entities list inside SECTOR i added a part that said if exhausted then added :=true). The array index issue is fixed but it fucks up placement.
